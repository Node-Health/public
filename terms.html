        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The App serves to provide structured recording, visualization, and analysis of health data for <b>personal orientation only</b>. It is not a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment and does not constitute medical advice. Users should always consult with a medical professional before making any health-related decisions.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The use of the Node Health App is currently completely free of charge.<br>
            However, Node Health UG reserves the right to offer individual functions or content for a fee in the future. In such a case, the user will be clearly and transparently informed about the resulting costs in advance and must expressly agree to them.<br>
            Payments will then be processed exclusively through the respective App Store, subject to the terms and conditions of business and payment applicable there.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Registration is mandatory for using the App.<br>
            The user is responsible for all data entered into the App and for its accuracy. Incorrect information — such as age or gender — may lead to inaccurate assessments or recommendations and are the user's responsibility.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
            6. Data Protection
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The processing of personal data - especially health data — is carried out exclusively in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br>
            Details are regulated in the <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium">Privacy Policy</a>.<br>
            Data is stored locally and encrypted or — where cloud-based services are used — processed only with the express consent of the user.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            All content, designs, logos, source codes, and texts of the App are protected by copyright.<br>
            Users are granted a simple, non-transferable, revocable right of use to use the App within the scope of these terms.<br>
            Reproduction, distribution, or public performance is prohibited.

            8. Availability and Changes
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Node Health UG strives for use with minimal interruption but does not guarantee the constant availability of the App.<br>
            The content or technical aspects of the App may be changed, expanded, or restricted at any time.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
            9. Disclaimer of Liability
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This App is for <b>informational and educational purposes</b> only and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The lab values, analyses, and recommendations presented in the App are based on publicly available sources and are **not a substitute for medical advice** from qualified professionals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Node Health UG makes no guarantee for the completeness, accuracy, timeliness, availability, or suitability of the provided content and functions for a specific purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Please note that the reference values displayed in the App may differ from the reference values of individual laboratories. Reasons for this may include methodological differences, device settings, reagents, or population-specific norms of individual labs. Users should therefore always discuss their lab findings with a professional in the respective medical context.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Use of the App is at the user's own risk.<br>
            Liability of Node Health UG for damages, particularly health impairments, resulting from the use of the App or the interpretation of its content, is excluded—unless there is intent or gross negligence.

        <p class="text-gray-700 font-bold mt-4">10.1 General</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The user is subject to the currently valid Terms & Conditions at the time of using the Node Health App.<br>
            Node Health UG reserves the right to amend these terms if necessary and provided the user is not unreasonably disadvantaged.<br>
            Amendments may occur for the following reasons, among others:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4 text-gray-700 mb-4">

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Node Health UG will inform the user about intended changes that do not exclusively change their rights and obligations to their advantage, at least six weeks before they take effect, directly within the App.<br>
            The notice will clearly explain the planned changes and highlight the affected sections.<br>
            <b>Active consent</b> to the amended Terms & Conditions is required for continued use of the App. If this consent is not given, the App cannot be used further after the changes take effect.

            If the user does not give consent to the amended Terms & Conditions, the App can no longer be used from the date the new terms take effect.<br>
            Continued use requires the user's express consent.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 font-bold mt-4">10.4 Changes to App Services</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Irrespective of the preceding regulations, Node Health UG reserves the right to change, adapt, or further develop the App's content and functions at any time to improve user-friendliness, functionality, or security.<br>
            Such changes do not require separate user consent.
